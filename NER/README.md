The notebooks contain my early attempts at Named Entity Recognition (NER). NER is a method that can help to computationally identify people, places, and things (of various kinds) in a text or collection of texts. I've used Ruth Ginsberg's obituary as input data. 


Notebooks:

- Named Entity Regonition.

- Part of Speech Tagging and Keywords Extraction
