The notebooks contain my early attempts at topic modelling. The datasets used in this project are open source and freely available online. The data includes both fake and truthful news articles from multiple domains. The truthful news articles published contain true description of real world events, while the fake news websites contain claims that are not aligned with facts. 

Notebooks:

- LDA Topic Modelling with Gensim.

- LDA Topic Modelling with sklearn.
